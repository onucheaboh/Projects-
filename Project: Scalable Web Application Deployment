Serverless Project: "Scalable Web Application Deployment"

Project Description: Scalable Web Application Deployment is a project that involves designing and implementing a web application architecture that can 
handle increasing levels of traffic and user demand. The goal of this project is to ensure that the web application can scale up or down automatically
to meet the demands of the users without compromising performance, reliability, or security.

Technology used: 
- Designed and developed a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.
- Used AWS Cognito for authentication and authorization of users, and DynamoDB for data storage and retrieval.


Project Outcome:
- Implemented serverless architecture to enable automatic scaling and reduce infrastructure costs.
- Resulted in improved application performance and reduced infrastructure costs by 50%.
- Received positive feedback from end-users on the application's responsiveness and ease-of-use.
